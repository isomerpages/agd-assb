MOF Appreciation Reception
--------------------------

23 Jul 2019

The Ministry of Finance (MOF) organised a reception to show appreciation to individuals who have contributed to MOF and its agencies as members of boards, committees, councils and panels on 22 July 2019, Monday.  DPM Heng Swee Keat hosted the reception; 2M Lawrence Wong and 2M Indranee Rajah also attended it. 

We would like to thank past and present ASSB Advisory Committee members for their commitment and contributions to the financial reporting framework for Statutory Boards in Singapore.
